# Tip-Calculator
Learning Xcode and Swift!

Thrilled to post my first app, a purple tip calculator! 

Time spent: 8 hours (at least 5 of that was spent in Google)

Required User Stories:
  * [x] User can input their bill amount, including decimals 
  * [x] User can choose tip amount 
  * [x] User can see both tip amount and total amount 
  
Optional User Stories:
  * [x] Added custom font (Avenir) 
  * [x] Created an app icon and modified launch screen 
  * [x] The bill amount text field is customized beyond what interface builder provides, and it has placeholder text

I followed CodePath's tutorial to build the functionality, https://gist.github.com/timothy1ee/434cc97da182c490ea74#file-3-md.
