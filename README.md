# Tip-Calculator
Learning Xcode and Swift!

Thrilled to post my first app, a purple tip calculator! I followed CodePath's tutorial to build the functionality, https://gist.github.com/timothy1ee/434cc97da182c490ea74#file-3-md.

This app allows the user to input their bill amount (with a decimal pad keyboard), choose the tip percentage (with a segmented control), and see both the tip amount and total amount.

I customized its appearence using interface builder. I also created a custom border style for the text field with placeholder text and added a custom font. To finish it, I created an purple app icon and launch color to match.

Total, this project took me 8 hours (at least 5 of that was spent in Google.)
